Early diagnosis and classification of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) into distinct stages of dementia—non-demented, very lightly affected, mildly affected, and moderately affected—represent a major problem for neurology and geriatric medicine. The purpose of this research is to investigate the possibility of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as a diagnostic method for grading the course of Alzheimer’s disease. Our goal is to use cutting edge machine learning algorithms to analyze fMRI patterns of brain activity and connectivity in order to distinguish between different stages of dementia. A thorough pipeline comprising data collection, preprocessing, feature exraction, model training, and validation makes up our methodology. Our findings show that machine learning models can efficiently discriminate between distinct phases of Alzheimer’s disease dementia when trained on data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). This method shows promise for tracking the progression of the disease and earlier identification. The significance of applying fMRI and cutting-edge computational techniques to enhance our comprehension of Alzheimer’s Disease and enhance its treatment is emphasized by this study. These findings improve patient care and provide the groundwork for tailored therapy interventions, which will ultimately improve outcomes for people who are impacted.
